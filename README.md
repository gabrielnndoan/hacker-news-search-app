Hacker News Search App, an application created with React, has two pages users can navigate to:

1. "/search", which is a page that allows users to search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api)

2. "/history", which is a page that shows users a list of their past searches from this session.
